        <h4>Grand Canyon - April 2019</h4>
        <p>We started our Grand Circle in Zion National Park and proceeded to drive around, in a circle if you will, until finally reaching the Grand Canyon South Rim on day five of our eight day trip. We couldn't actually see over the rim when we entered the park because of all the trees and we decided to make a quick stop at one of the viewpoints to get our first look at the Grand Canyon before heading to the lodge. It was late in the day, we'd been driving for hours, and honestly after being surrounded by beautiful views all week I really didn't think this view was going to be any different than the others. Beautiful sure, but I was jaded and tired at that point. We parked the car and started walking to the edge and as soon as I saw it I stopped walking and said, "Holy shit". I mean Zion National Park is beautiful. Antelope Canyon is amazing. But the Grand Canyon is something else entirely.</p>
      </br>
      <p>We were only at the Grand Canyon for three days but could easily have stayed there for weeks and not gotten bored. There are endless amounts of trails and if you plan ahead there is camping at the bottom of the canyon. If you need help planning out which hike you'd like to do I recommend checking out the books by Falcon Guide like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hiking-Grand-Canyon-National-Park/dp/1493023004">this one.</a> This book is usually available in the gift store at the park or you could pick it up online before your trip.</p>

        <h5>South Rim</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>When people say they're going to the Grand Canyon, they generally mean the South Rim. The South Rim is more accessible and it's been more built up, within the park is Grand Canyon Village which offers plenty of lodging, restaurants, and shops.</li>
          <li> The Grand Canyon gets around five million visitors a year. It is insanely busy. Similar to other parks in the Grand Circle, summer is the busiest time of year but it's always crowded. Try to book early and stay within Grand Canyon Village.</li>
          <li>Parking is limited around the park so make use of the shuttles, otherwise you'll find that you've driven all the way to a certain spot only to not find any parking. You can also take the shuttle to a viewpoint and then use the rim trail to get back to the village.</li>
          <li>As soon as you start to do any research into hiking at the Grand Canyon you'll see warnings about not hiking all the way down and back in one day. While technically doable, it is hard. Going down is easy, going up not so much. Don't be that person who has to get rescued by a park ranger.</li>
          <li>If you have time, do a jeep tour! We did one through Pink Jeeps and it was very informative and interesting. It's also a good way to see a lot of different viewpoints in a relatively short amount of time.</li>
        </ul>
      </br>
        <h5>North Rim</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Okay I haven't been here yet but I'm already planning a trip to the north rim to compare to the south rim. Unlike the south rim, the north rim is not open year round. It typically opens mid-May and closes mid-October.</li>
        </ul>

            <h4>Costa Rica - January 2018</h4>
            <p>We visited two locations while in Costa Rica, Arenal Volcano area and Drake Bay. Since this was my first time traveling to Costa Rica and my Spanish isn't great I used <a href="https://www.costaricaexpeditions.com" target="_blank">Costa Rica Expeditions</a> to plan everything out which was abosolutely worth it. Costa Rica is a gorgeous country so I really don't think you can go wrong visiting any region. Here is some general info about the areas we visited.</p>
          </br>
            <h5>Arenal Volcano</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Popular destination spot, which means there are plenty of places to stay and eat. Downside, it <em>is</em> a popular place which means it can get crowded.</li>
              <li> Stayed at Hotel Arenal Manoa. Really nice place to stay, the room we stayed in was great and the hotel has an awesome restaurant and several pools on the property with swim up bars. It is big and has a "resorty" feel to it but I think most of them in this area are like that.</li>
              <li>One of the top attactions of this area is the Mistico Arenal Hanging Bridges Park. It's definitely worth getting a private tour guide for this park. There is wildlife but because it's a popular place the animals tend to keep their distance and they can be hard to spot. We wouldn't have spotted 80% of the things our guide pointed out.</li>
              <li>There are a couple hot springs in the area. Like a lot of things in the area they can get crowded but it's still an nice way to finish the day.</li>
            </ul>
          </br>
            <h5>Drake Bay</h5>
            <ul>
              <li>Also a popular place to go but a little more remote. We had to take a small plane from San Jose to get here, then we drove for 10 minutes and hopped on a boat to get to the inn. Because of the difficulty in getting here it's not nearly as crowded as other places.</li>
              <li>We stayed at Aguila De Osa Inn. I'm sure there several other nice places to stay in the area but I can't imagine staying anywhere else but this place. Plus they had two adorable dogs that you get to hang out with.</li>
              <li> The two major draws of this area are snorkeling/scuba diving in Cano Island and visiting Corcovado National Park. We only had three days in this area which was a mistake, defintely worth making your stay in this area longer because the snorkeling is great and Corcovado National Park is huge and it's worth multiple trips.</li>
            </ul>

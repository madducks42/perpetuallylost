            <h4>Lake Tahoe - September 2018</h4>
            <p>We visited the Lake Tahoe area over Labor Day weekend in 2018 for a family related event. In addition to eating delicous food and drinking wine all I weekend I had two other goals, take some epic landscape and astrophotography shots. I didn't have much luck on the former but the latter worked out pretty well. For those who have never been to the Lake Tahoe area here is some basic information.</p>
            </br>
            <h4>Lake Tahoe</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Don't go on popular weekends like Labor Day weekend or Fourth of July. The reason why I didn't get very many landscape images was because the place was packed all weekend. A lot of the popular trails that have awesome views are on the south side of the lake and I wasn't even able to find parking within a mile of any trail head. If going on a busy weekend is your only option, try to plan out some hiking or photography adventures that aren't on the south side of the lake or maybe go out of that region a bit.</li>
              <li>If you like astrophotography I found this to be a really good area for it. There's a place on the lake known as "Bonsai Rock" (pictured below) that makes for some really nice foreground. In general you won't struggle to find nice foreground for your shots and the tempatures are bit cooler at night with low humidty which generally make for clearer skies.</li>
              <li>Obviously Tahoe is popular during both winter and summer, if you're doing a winter trip be prepared for some of the roads to get pretty bad. Occasionally roads will be completely shut down or vehicles will be required to have tire chains.</li>
            </ul>

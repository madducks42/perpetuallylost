            <h4>About Me</h4>
            <p>Just another millenial with a camera and a passion for travel...when I can afford it. In addition to being a photography nerd, I'm also a comic book nerd, video game nerd, Magic the Gathering nerd as well as basically being employed as full-time nerd. See a theme there? I begrundingly reside in New England where I complain about the weather for approximately nine months out of the year and I'm the only one who is positively delighted when it's 95 degrees and 100% humidity. </br>
            </br>
            A lot of my travel is in the Northeast area but I occasionally escape to other areas in the US or sometimes even manage to swing a trip an international trip. Landscape and astropho are usually my areas of focus but I do enjoy photographing wildlife and occasionaly partake in street photography. </br>
            </br>
            *Photo credit for the image to the left goes to my boyfriend who always sneaks pictures of me when I'm not paying attention.</p>

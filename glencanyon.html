        <h4>Glen Canyon</h4>
        <p>One of the challenges to planning out the Grand Circle trip was that we only had eight days so we really had to plan for places that were along the way.  And I also needed to plan something along the way that didn’t involve strenuous hiking to appease my boyfriend and the kid I was dragging along on this trip. Glen Canyon fit the bill because it was good place to stop between Zion and the south rim, was central to a lot of cool stuff like Antelope Canyon and Grand Staircase-Escalante Monument, and Lake Powell offered plenty of non-hiking activities. We stayed at Lake Powell Resort and Marina which has an incredible view of the lake and a pool so it’s a good spot for a family vacation.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I honestly I have mixed feelings on this portion of the trip. There are two major touristy spots, Antelope Canyon and Horseshoe Bend. Zion and the Grand Canyon are obviously touristy spots as well but there is so much to do in both of those locations that it is possible to somewhat avoid the crowds. But Antelope Bend is basically just one spot that a lot of people visit to take a picture, there isn’t anything else around it. And Antelope Canyon is accessible only by private tours and is extremely crowded. All the reviews you see about it and people commenting on “being herded like cattle” is accurate. Both locations are very unique and pretty. I’ m glad I saw them. I’ll probably never go back. We didn’t get a chance to visit Grand Staircase-Escalante Monument which I very much regret. That might bring me back to this area someday. Also Lake Powell is a very popular house boating destination so that might be a more unique way to spend time in the area.</p>

        <h5>Tips For Lake Powell</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Lake Powell is very popular during the summer, as mentioned above it's a very popular place for house boating. If you'd like to stay somewhere more interesting there are usually houseboats for rent as long as it's in season.</li>
          <li>We stayed at Lake Powell Resorts and Marinas which is one of, if not the only, place to stay that's on the water. Overall it's a pretty nice place but the food options aren't so great (which is a common complaint in reviews). If the place is even remotely busy around dinner time you likely won't get a table.</li>
          <li>Page, Az is a short-drive away and offers more places to stay and eat but doesn't offer any nice views.</li>
          <li>Make sure to do a float down Lake Powell! The lake is the best part of this area and boating trips are a great way to get some amazing views of the canyon and learn about the area. If you have the time I'd recommend one of the full day trips.</li>
        </ul>
      <br>
        <h5>Tips For Antelope Canyon</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>This area is crazy busy. It's also on private land and only accessible via a guide so be sure to book a tour ahead of time especially if it's for a photography tour. The photography tours are more limited so they fill up faster. </li>
          <li>It's definitely worth doing a longer tour that includes other canyons in the area besides Upper & Lower Canyon. They're cool to see and if you're doing a photography tour it will give you a chance to practice shooting in the area before getting to the more crowded canyons. </li>
          <li>The two main canyons, Upper & Lower Antelope Canyon, are often very crowded. The canyons are very narrow in spots so you tend to notice the crowds here more so than you would at other popular Grand Circle locations. If you're doing a photography tour you'll have a very short amount of time to get your shots and you'll often have to shoot over people's heads.</li>
        </ul>
      <br>
        <h5>Photography Tips</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>I used my wide-angle Sigma 14-24mm a lot in this area. It was useful for Horseshoe Bend as well as Antelope Canyon.</li>
          <li>If you want to take pictures in Antelope Canyon make sure you book a Photography Tour. If you don't specifically book a photography tour you won't be able to bring a tripod.</li>
          <li>This was probably the dustiest stop on our Grand Circle trip. Be sure to take good care of your camera equipment and try to avoid changing lenses on any tours.</li>

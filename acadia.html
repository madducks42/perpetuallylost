            <h4>Acadia National Park</h4>
            <p>I managed to live on the east coast for almost a decade without even being aware of Acadia. It wasn't until I got into astrophotography that I started to notice a lot of photographs from Acadia. Since discovering that there is a phenomenal national park a mere five hours from me (okay the drive is painful and long) I've been there twice; once over the summer and once during winter. There is a lot of hype about Acadia National Park and Bar Harbor, the small town next to it, and in my opinion it very much lives up to it's reputation. The park is beautiful no matter when you visit, there are different pro's and con's to visiting during summer or winter.</p>
          </br>
          <h4>General Info</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>There are plenty of places to stay in Bar Harbor and the surronding area. Perks of staying in town mean that you can walk to all the restaurants and bars; staying outside of town means you'll have to drive in for food/entertainment but you'll have a more quit place to relax in after exploring the park all day. It also seems to be a little cheaper to stay outside the town.</li>
            <li>I've only stayed in Bar Harbor once so far at Acadia Hotel which was delightful and like most places in Bar Harbor it was a short walk to plenty of restaurants and bars.</li>
            <li>Just outside of Bar Harbor there are a lot of little cottages and hotels available to stay in. I stayed in Edgewater Motel & Cottages on my first trip to Acadia and it was a nice place to stay. It's nothing particulary fancy but it's very relaxing and has a nice view of the water.
          </ul>
        </br>
            <h4>Summer</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Visiting the park over summer means you'll get to experience nice weather, it'll be warm and mostly dry. </li>
              <li>Most, if not all of the trails will be open during the summer.</li>
              <li>Because of the nice weather and trail availablity, the park's busiest season is over the summer. This means that lodging will be more expensive and you'll have to book further in advance. The park itself will be more crowded and parking is more difficult throughout the park so you're better off parking in the main lot and taking the free shuttle.</li>
            </ul>
          </br>
            <h4>Winter</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>Also a popular place to go but a little more remote. We had to take a small plane from San Jose to get here, then we drove for 10 minutes and hopped on a boat to get to the inn. Because of the difficulty in getting here it's not nearly as crowded as other places.</li>
              <li>We stayed at Aguila De Osa Inn. I'm sure there several other nice places to stay in the area but I can't imagine staying anywhere else but this place. Plus they had two adorable dogs that you get to hang out with.</li>
              <li> The two major draws of this area are snorkeling/scuba diving in Cano Island and visiting Corcovado National Park. We only had three days in this area which was a mistake, defintely worth making your stay in this area longer because the snorkeling is great and Corcovado National Park is huge and it's worth multiple trips.</li>
            </ul>
            </br>
            <h4>Spring/Fall</h4>
            <ul>
              <li>I haven't been to the park in spring or fall so I can't personally comment on anything. From my research spring isn't a bad time to go but the weather will likely be rainy and some of the trails may still be closed. Going during the fall may be one of the better times to visit the park since the weather should still be nice, the trails won't have closed for winter yet, and it's less busy than summer.</li>

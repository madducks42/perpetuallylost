        <h4>Acadia National Park</h4>
        <p>I managed to live on the east coast for almost a decade without even being aware of Acadia. It wasn't until I got into astrophotography that I started to notice a lot of photographs from Acadia. Since discovering that there is a phenomenal national park a mere five hours from me (okay the drive is painful and long) I've been there twice; once over the summer and once during winter. There is a lot of hype about Acadia National Park and after visiting it twice I think it very much lives up to it's reputation. There are plenty of places to stay in the small town of Bar Harbor which is right outside the park. Perks of staying in town mean that you can walk to all the restaurants and bars; staying outside of town means you'll have to drive in for food/entertainment but you'll have a more quiet place to relax in after exploring the park all day. It also seems to be a little cheaper to stay outside the town.</p>
      </div>
      <div class = "blog_tips">
        <h4>Summer</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Visiting the park over summer means you'll get to experience nice weather, it'll be warm and mostly dry. </li>
          <li>Most, if not all of the trails will be open during the summer.</li>
          <li>Because of the nice weather and trail availability, the park's busiest season is over the summer. This means that lodging will be more expensive and you'll have to book further in advance. The park itself will be more crowded and parking is more difficult throughout the park so you're better off parking in the main lot and taking the free shuttle.</li>
        </ul>
        </br>
        <h4>Winter</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>I think winter might actually be my favorite time to visit Acadia. If you can time your visit when there is snow on the ground the park really captures the "winter wonderland" look.</li>
          <li>Because winter is the off-season the area is significantly less busy. A lot of hotels and bed and breakfasts close during winter so lodging is more limited. But several places stay open year round and most of the bars and restaurants in town stay open year round as well.</li>
          <li> Like the town of Bar Harbor, parts of the park are closed during winter as well. There is still plenty to see and do but if there is something in particular you would like to see be sure to check the Acadia National Park website to make sure that area is accessible.</li>
        </ul>
        </br>
        <h4>Spring/Fall</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>I haven't been to the park in spring or fall so I can't personally comment on anything. From my research spring isn't a bad time to go but the weather will likely be rainy and some of the trails may still be closed. Going during the fall may be one of the better times to visit the park since the weather should still be nice, the trails won't have closed for winter yet, and it's less busy than summer. They also have an annual astrophotography event at end of September if that's something of interest to you.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Adirondacks</h4>
        <p>I visited the Adirondacks for the first time in 2018. I love to camp and I'd been on the search for somewhere in the Northeast that was a bit more remote. My niece had recently moved to Watertown, NY and when I looked up her town on Google Maps I saw all this green space around it and decided to investigate. I had only camped in NY once, when I drove from California to Massachusetts and camped along the way, my last stop was at a campground in upstate NY. I remember being surprised by how beautiful it was. When I think of New York, I think of New York City. And even though I had been in the upstate area once and knew there was a lot more to state I forgot about that over the years. My visit to the Adirondacks in 2018 reminded me of just how much more there was to the state.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The campground that we stayed at on that first trip (and every trip since) was Forked Lake Campground. It's state run campground on a beautiful lake that offers primitive campsites along the lake edge. Most of the camp sites are boat-in, there are a few campsites that allow trailer/rv's but the vast majority are tent only. The Adirondacks are about a five hour drive from Boston and New York City, and about three hours from Montreal. Because of their distance from most major cities the campgrounds aren't as crowded as a lot of the other campgrounds in Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont. A lot of the restaurants and breweries in the area have outdoor seating that is dog friendly so if you're traveling with your dog that makes things a little easier. This is probably my favorite camping location in all the Northeast with Maine in a close second.</p>

        <h4>General Tips</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>While not as crowded as other popular camping spots in the Northeast some of the better camping sites do book months in advance. At Forked Lake Campground there are three island sites that are very popular and difficult to book. So if you can, book far in advance to get the best sites possible.</li>
          <li>There are a lot of small towns in the area so you have plenty of options for food and lodging if you don't want to camp. There are also several breweries in the area that are pretty good.</li>
          <li>I loved staying at Forked Lake Campground but it is more a rugged campsite. No showers or bathrooms (there is one bathroom at the entrance); campsites have an outhouse. If that's not your thing there are lots of other options in the area for camping that have more amenities.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Photography Tips</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>This is a pretty great area for astrophotography. There's not a lot of light pollution and lots of options for compelling foregrounds.</li>
          <li>My favorite lenses for this area are a 24-70mm and 70-200mm. The former is great for landscape and the latter is good for some of the wildlife in the area. I also bring along my Rokinon 14mm for astrophotography but I sometimes use the 24-70mm instead.</li>
          <li>The are also a few waterfalls in the area that can be fun to shoot, so bringing alone some ND filters is a good idea.</li>
        </ul>

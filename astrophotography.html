        <h4>Astrophotography</h4>
        <p>After taking a long hiatus from photography it was actually astrophotography that drew me back in. While I love street photography and really enjoying looking at it, it's not something I'm super comfortable doing. But going to remote locations where there isn't another soul in site and hanging out in the dark by myself for hours? Yeah, that's right up my alley.</p>
      </br>
      <p>As much as possible now I try to plan trips around the lunar cycle so I can spend a night or two doing astrophotography. Below are some of my favorite locations I've shot so far.

        <h5>Astrophotography Locations</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Bonsai Rock, Lake Tahoe. I mostly enjoyed this location because it was something different from what I'm used to in the Northeast. I wouldn't necessarily recommend going here just for this location, but if you live near Tahoe or are going there for a vacation you should definitely check it out! It does show up on Google maps but you'll have to do some adventuring down a rocky/sandy slope to find it.</li>
          <li>Pemaquid Point, Maine. This is probably the closest location to Boston that I really enjoy shooting in. There is a pretty lighthouose and some really unique rock formations in this area.</li>
          <li>Forked Lake, NY. This is located in the Adirondacks. I have mixed feelings about this area for astrophotography. There are lots of lakes in the area, included Forked Lake, so you can get some pretty reflections in your foreground. I've also seen airglow in the area which isn't unusual. Unfortuantley overcast nights are also common, even during summer. But if you get lucky you can capture some truly amazing images here.</li>
          <li>Lubec, Maine. This is roughly an hour and a half past Acadia National Park. Lubec is a small town in Maine that no one has ever heard of, and it just so happens to have some epic cliffs that rival Acadia. There are also several pebble beaches in the area. It doesn't have all the restaurant and lodging choices of Acadia, but it also doesn't have the crowds.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Costa Rica - January 2018</h4>
        <p>Our first time visiting Costa Rica was in January 2018 and we visited two locations there, Arenal Volcano and Drake Bay. This post will discuss the Arenal Volcano area, if you want to learn more about Drake Bay <a href="drakebay.html" target="_blank">click here!</a> If you're just starting your research into Costa Rica you've probably come across Arenal Volcano. This is one of the more popular destinations in Costa Rica and for good reason! There are lots of things to do in the area and plenty of lodging and food options for different budgets. Costa Rica is a gorgeous country so I really don't think you can go wrong visiting any region, below is some more specific information about the Arenal Volcano area.</p>
        </br>
        <p>Also we always book our trips through <a href="https://www.costaricaexpeditions.com" target="_blank">Costa Rica Expeditions</a> who are abosolutely amazing and really make planning these trips easy. I usually do all the planning for our trips but I happened to use them for our first trip to Costa Rica and now I can't imagine doing it any other way.</p>

        <h5>Arenal Volcano</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Popular destination spot, which means there are plenty of places to stay and eat. Downside, it <em>is</em> a popular place which means it can get crowded.</li>
          <li> Stayed at Hotel Arenal Manoa. Really nice place to stay, the room we stayed in was great and the hotel has an awesome restaurant and several pools on the property with swim up bars. It is big and has a "resorty" feel to it but I think most of them in this area are like that.</li>
          <li>One of the top attractions of this area is the Mistico Arenal Hanging Bridges Park. It's definitely worth getting a private tour guide for this park. There is wildlife but because it's a popular place the animals tend to keep their distance and they can be hard to spot. We wouldn't have spotted 80% of the things our guide pointed out.</li>
          <li>There are a couple hot springs in the area. Like a lot of things in the area they can get crowded but it's still an nice way to finish the day.</li>

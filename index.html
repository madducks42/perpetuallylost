<h1>Perpetually Lost Photography</h1>

<!-- Intro -->
<div id="intro">
<p>Just another millenial with a camera and a passion for travel...when I can afford it. In addition to being a photography nerd I'm also a professional nerd for a living and currently reside in New England. A lot of my travel is in the Northeast area but I occasionally escape to other areas in the US or sometimes even manage to swing a trip an international trip. </p>

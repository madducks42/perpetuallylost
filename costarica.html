            <p>Costa Rica was always on the top of the list for places that I wanted to visit and it did not dissapoint. I spent about a week there in January 2018 in two different locations, Arenal Volcano and Drake Bay. While in Arenal Volcano I stayed at Hotel Arenal Manoa and checked out the Mistico Hanging Bridges and did a hike up the Arenal volcano. Definitely a great area to stay in because of the amount of stuff to do in the area. The second part of the trip was spent in the Drake Bay area and I stayed at Aguila De Osa Inn. This area is a little more remote to get to; we had to drive back to San Jose where we took a small plane to Drake Bay and then took a boat over to the inn. It's absolutely worth it though. Because of the remoteness it's less crowded and there is plenty to do in the area. Aside from relaxing at inn I did some snorkeling at Ca√±o Island and spent a day at Corcovado National Park.</p>
            
            <p>Since this was my first time traveling to Costa Rica and my Spanish isn't great I used Costa Rica Expeditions to plan everything out which was abosolutely worth it.    </p>

        <p>Just another millenial with a camera and a passion for travel...when I can afford it. In addition to being a photography nerd I'm also a professional nerd for a living and currently reside in New England. A lot of my travel is in the Northeast area but I occasionally escape to other areas in the US or sometimes even manage to swing a trip an international trip.</p>
